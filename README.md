## Projects
- [`Instagram_filters-project.ipynb`](https://github.com/jvataidee/ComputerVision101/blob/main/Instagram_filters-project.ipynb):This project aims to replicate how Instagram filters work. Users created two Instagram-like filters: a pencil sketch filter, which generates a sketch of the existing image, and a cartoon filter, which produces a "cartoonized" version of the input image.
- [`blemish-project.py`](https://github.com/jvataidee/ComputerVision101/blob/main/blemish-project.py):
- [`cromakey-project.py`](https://github.com/jvataidee/ComputerVision101/blob/main/cromakey-project.py):
- [`assigment-QR-Code-Detector.ipynb`](https://github.com/jvataidee/ComputerVision101/blob/main/assigment-QR-Code-Detector.ipynb):This project implements a QR Code Detector and Decoder using OpenCV. The goal is to read an image, detect the QR Code in the image, draw a bounding box around the detected QR Code, print the decoded text, and save and display the result image.
- [`assigment_featureimagealignment.ipynb`](https://github.com/jvataidee/ComputerVision101/blob/main/assigment_featureimagealignment.ipynb):This project addresses the restoration of misaligned historical images, feature detection and matching, homography calculation, and warping to achieve an aligned, colorized image. It's an application of computer vision to preserve history and visual memory. Users work with the Prokudin-Gorskii collection, which contains some of the earliest color images in history.
- [`assigment_panorama.ipynb`](https://github.com/jvataidee/ComputerVision101/blob/main/assigment_panorama.ipynb):This project focuses on creating panoramic images using OpenCV. Images are read and stitched together to create a larger panoramic image, which is then saved and returned.
- [`assignment-autofocus.ipynb`](https://github.com/jvataidee/ComputerVision101/blob/main/assigment_panorama.ipynb):
